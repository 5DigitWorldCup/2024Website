# General Information
1. The 5 Digit World Cup 2023 (5WC2023) is a **country-based**, **world cup style** tournament played in the osu! game mode.
   - Players from countries or territories (as seen on their profile flag) that are under a protectorate, sovereign state, or otherwise closely related to another country may choose to play for that country if the country listed on their profile is unable to field enough players to form a valid team.
   - We have a complete list of which countries may play for which territories.
   - Players with a generic continent-based flag (this is a rare case) may play for any country so long as they provide proof of citizenship or residence per our conditions in the “Changing Country” section.
2. This is a **4v4** team-based tournament with a minimum team size of 6 and a maximum team size of 8.
3. The rank range is **#10,000 - #99,999** after the “BWS” or badge-weighting system is applied to a participant’s rank using the formula described in the Registration section.
   - This formula is used to weigh badges against a player’s rank. This penalizes those with exceptional tournament performance by making it exponentially more difficult to play in rank-restricted tournaments. If you do not have a tournament profile badge, this does not affect you in any way.
4. The tournament will be played in **TeamVS**, **ScoreV2** with **NF** enforced.
5. Mappools will be released and showcased the Monday before the next round of matches takes place.
6. All times on the sheets will be in **UTC+0**.

# Rules
1. Violations of rules from our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WxX2UkdSMq) will impact your standing in the tournament. The rules on this document extend to cover our Discord server which is viewed as an official communications platform, as is osu!Bancho, and will be treated as such.
2. Players and staff are expected to uphold the [osu! community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Rules) at all times.
3. Administration reserves the right to punish - as they see fit on a case-by-case basis - toxicity, obscene language, slurs, and other derogatory language or behavior displayed in any match chat, community, or social media platform, including but not limited to osu!, Twitch, Discord, Twitter, and private messages therein.
   - This rule is intentionally vague. Basically, administration reserves the right to moderate the community however they wish.
4. Multiaccounting, cheating, and other foul play is not allowed. Rosters submitted in bad faith (for example, if an obvious cheater is on the team) will result in immediate disqualification of the team with a report made to the osu! Tournament Committee.
5. Should a player be restricted for foul play while the tournament is ongoing, administration reserves the right to disqualify teams entirely and replay the bracket history in a fashion appropriate based on the stage of the tournament.
6. Custom skin elements must not be used such that they alter core gameplay elements or mechanics in unintended ways.
7. If a map is to be replayed for any reason (aborted by referee, etc.) the roster must remain the same. If the match was aborted due to a player experiencing a technical or personal issue so severe that they are unable to play osu!, the team may swap that player out for another player on the roster.
8. If a player disconnects from the match, their score will count as zero (0) unless adequate proof of a “last known score” is provided. Some examples are:
   - Screenshot of the score results screen using the osu! web screenshot tool (Shift+F12)
   - Livestream, VOD, or other recording of the score
   - A replay file
9. Players are expected to keep the match running smoothly without delay. Harassment of staff members, toxicity towards other teams, and/or other language in chat or smoke that violates the community rules will result in immediate disqualification, pertinent to the judgement of administration.
10. Instructions from referees and administration must be followed.
11. Referees may be lenient or strict with the timers at their discretion, pertinent to the rules laid out in the Timers & Timeouts section.
12. Administration reserves the right to alter these rules at any point. This is a living document. Any changes are guaranteed to be announced through an official channel at the time of change.
13. Administration may request a liveplay or recordings of individual players or teams at any moment without warning.

# Registration
1. bwsRank = curRank^0.98978^badges^2
   - **This BWS is harsher than normal**. The ranges below describe the criteria for playing with badges.
     - 0 badges = #10,000+
     - 1 badge = #10,997+ (normally 10.6k)
     - 2 badges = #14,715+ (was 12.7k)
     - 3 badges = #24,403+ (was 17.3k)
     - 4 badges = #51,827+ (was 27k)
     - 5 badges or more cannot play (was 49.7k)
   - [View this graph on Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jocsmzdu3j)
2. **Registrants will individually visit https://5wc.stagec.xyz/ and must login via osu! and Discord.**
   - Players must not be restricted while registering
3. There will be **no rank buffer**. You must be exactly within the rank range, after BWS, once the registration period ends.
4. Once registrations are closed, the rank restriction is lifted.
5. Staff members cannot play, but streamers and commentators (only those who have the “Helper” role in our Discord server) may.
6. **All players and country organizers** must remain in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WxX2UkdSMq) so long as their team is not eliminated from the tournament.
7. If a player did not register for the tournament during the registration phase, they will not be allowed to play in the tournament. **There will be no exceptions to this rule under any circumstances**.

## Changing Country
8. As this is a country-based tournament, players will be automatically registered to the country associated with their osu! profile flag.
9. If you are a **citizen** or **permanent resident** of another country and wish to play for that country, open a ticket in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WxX2UkdSMq) (#tickets, red button) and we will assist you.
   - You must provide us with one (1) of the following forms of identification. You must take a picture of the documentation held up against your logged-in osu! client, connected to osu!Bancho, with your username clearly visible.
     - Passport which shows your country
     - Permanent residence card
     - Government ID card
   - The documents provided to us must not be expired.
   - You may censor any personal information except your country and date of birth.
   - Should you wish to not make a ticket, DM Timper#0619 on Discord for a one-on-one private chat.
   - Providing false documents will result in an immediate ban from the tournament.
   - Please view these as an example
     - [Logged in osu! profile](https://ibb.co/h8jRJTd)
       - Make sure to have the profile menu in the top right opened, else it will not be valid!
     - [Logged in osu! client](https://ibb.co/s97VCbz)
10. Living and working in another country without a permanent residence or citizenship does not count.
11. Dual citizenship counts as citizenship under this rule.
12. Some countries may be merged with the following designated countries should their country’s team not have enough registrants. To be clear - this only applies to countries who receive less than 6 registrants.
    - Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands may play for the United States.
    - Martinique, New Caledonia, French Guiana, Mayotte, Saint Martin, Guadeloupe, and French Polynesia may play for France.
    - Isle of Man, Cayman Islands, Anguilla, Jersey, Bermuda, Gibraltar, and Guernsey may play for the United Kingdom.
    - Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, and Saba may play for the Netherlands.
    - Greenland may play for Denmark.
    - Cook Islands may play for New Zealand.
    - The Åland Islands may play for either Finland or Sweden.
    - Luxembourg may play for Belgium.
    - Players with a flag generic to their continent (such as “European Union”) or other flag where the country of registration is impossible to identify (such as “Anonymous Proxy”) are required to follow our process as described in section 9 in order to register.

## Country Organizers
13. A country organizer is responsible for registering their country’s team through a private form.
14. Country organizers will be selected by the Host.
15. It is the country organizer’s responsibility to try out registrants and select the most competitive roster possible, per their discretion.
16. Country organizers may choose whether to play. They do not have to be the team captain, however they must select one.
17. Countries with fewer than 6 registrants will not be able to qualify. There will not be a “countryless” team.
18. Country organizers are responsible for selecting legitimate players. Those who appear to be multiaccounting or cheating despite passing screening will be reported to the account support team and tournament committee immediately.
    - The entire country will be immediately disqualified should this rule be deliberately breached, no exceptions.
 
# Qualifier Procedures
1. Qualifiers will be played in **Head to Head**, **ScoreV2** with **NF** enforced.
2. **Only 4 players per team will be able to play Qualifiers at the same time**.
3. The whole team does not need to be present to play qualifiers so long as 4 players are present.
4. Every country will play the qualifiers with the Top 32 scoring countries advancing to the Round of 32, seeded based on their performance as a team.
5. Qualifiers will consist of **4xNM**, **2xHD**, **2xHR**, **2xDT**, and **1xFM**.
6. Qualifiers will be played in order beginning with **NM1** and ending with **FM1**.
7. Qualifiers will be played through only **once**.
8. If a player disconnects during a map due to a technical issue, they're allowed to replay that map once.
   - A team is allotted exactly one disconnect redo. If multiple players disconnect on the same map, only one may replay it.
   - If there is proof of an intentional disconnect due to any non-technical issue, the score will be nullified.
   -  Further disconnects will result in a score of **zero (0)** for that player, regardless of incident.
9. All players will be playing the same qualifiers mappool.
10. It is requested that teams do not broadcast or share their results publicly to avoid seed manipulation.
11. All Teams will be able to schedule **their own Qualifier Lobbies** within the weekend and we will assign a Referee to that lobby.
12. The same FM rules apply to Qualifiers as in the Bracket Stages. These rules can be found under *Match Procedures - Freemod Rules* <- This should link to the Freemod Rules.

## Qualifier timers
13. Teams that are more than **5 minutes** late to their qualifier lobby will need to reschedule.
14. Teams have **120 seconds** between maps to change players.
15. Teams that submit decisions after a timer has expired will be penalized:
    - First offense: Written warning
    - Subsequent offenses: Force !mp start 10

# Match Procedures
1. Teams will receive a notification of their match **15 minutes** before the scheduled time by their designated referee.
   - If you do not receive a prompt notification, please ping your referee in Discord and then notify an admin if there are subsequent issues getting the match started.
2. Lateness to a match is defined as a team not having **four players** in the multiplayer lobby by the time the match is scheduled to begin.
3. Teams who are **5 minutes** late will forfeit their **protection**, **ban(s)**, and **first pick**.
   - The opponent may use this time to protect one map, ban one or two maps (depending on the round), and pick one map.
4. Teams who are **10 minutes** late will **forfeit** the match entirely.
   - Common sense will be applied if both teams agree to delay the match to a later time.
5. In the unlikely event that both teams do not have enough players to play the match after 10 minutes, the higher seeded team will win by default.
6. All matches will be played in **TeamVS** with **ScoreV2** and **NF** enforced.
7. If a player disconnects during a map due to a technical issue, they're allowed to replay that map once.
   - A team is allotted exactly one disconnect abort.
   - Further disconnects will not be cause for a match abort.
8. Decisions such as rolls, protections, and bans must be submitted by the captain. The rest of the team may pick maps on behalf of the captain. If a player says a map name or mod combo (e.g. HD2), and it is their team’s pick, that map will be played as if it was selected by the captain.
9. Common sense will be applied to mispicks. Correcting a mispick after the pick timer has finished is prohibited.
10. Teams may enact a replacement captain on the fly should the actual captain be absent for whatever reason. This must be posted in Discord and told to the referee.
11. Split or asynchronous lobbies are **not allowed**.

## Warm-ups
12. Warm-ups are allowed and will be played before the rolls.
13. When the referee sends the match reminder in the server, the captain will have to tell the referee that they **are skipping warmups** or **send a map link or ID** to that referee either through osu! or Discord DM. Not sending a map will result in no warmup for that team.
14. Warm-ups must not exceed 3 minutes in drain length (3:00).
    - Time counted after mods are applied **(NC is forbidden, DT is allowed)**
15. Warm-ups must not contain highly explicit audio. Referees may veto a warm-up should these rules be violated.

## Rolling
16. Captains will each !roll once when prompted by their referee.
17. The winner of the roll will **protect second**, **ban first**, and **pick first**.
    - If there is a tie, both captains will reroll until the tie is broken.
    - The winner is determined by who rolls the higher number.
 
## Protections
18. Protections (AKA protects) allow teams to prevent a map from being banned over the course of a match.
19. Each team will be given **1 protect** at the start of the match.
20. Any map that is protected **cannot be banned**.
21. A protected map may be picked by either team at any point.

## Bans
22. Ro32 & Ro16 - 1 ban
23. Quarterfinals onwards - 2 bans
24. Bans are **ABBA**.
25. Double bans are allowed, but an entire modpool may not be banned. This means that if there are two maps in a mod pool and one of them is banned, then the other map in that mod pool cannot be banned (thus, that map is inherently protected).

## Picks
26. Maps that are banned cannot be picked.
27. Picks alternate between teams after the first pick has been chosen until the match is finished.
28. Double picking is allowed.

## Timers & Timeouts
29. Teams will have **120 seconds** to protect, ban, and pick maps.
30. Teams will have **120 seconds** to ready up after a map has been selected during the pick phase.
31. Referees are asked to be strict with the enforcement of the timers, but are allowed to use their own discretion if needed.
32. Teams have **one (1) 120-second timeout** they may use at any time and for any reason while the match is in progress, including pre-picking phases and during their opponent’s turn.
    -  The timer must be called in chat **before any timer expires**. Timeouts called after a timer has expired will not be enforced and the match will continue, including the enforcement of delay of game punishments if necessary.
    - 120 seconds will be added to the end of any current ongoing timer if a timeout is properly called.
 
### Delay of game
33. A delay of game punishment will be enforced upon teams that are not ready by the time the appropriate match timers are finished.
34. Timer enforcement will be strict, but under some circumstances, it will be at the referee’s discretion. Match timers will be enforced strictly using the referee’s IRC log as a reference. Clear issues with Bancho itself are the sole exception for strict enforcement of timers.
35. First offense:
    - Written warning
    - A 15-30 second buffer to get the match started
    - Force !mp start 5 should the offending team still not be ready by this point.
36. Second offense:
    - If made during a ban, pick, or protect, forfeit of the map. The opponent will pick/ban/protect instead, the match will continue as if the offending team had appropriately picked.
    - If during the ready-up phase, force !mp start 15.
37. Subsequent offenses:
    - One additional point awarded to the opponent.
    - Match will continue as normal, unless the awarded point results in a victory for the opponent.

# Scheduling
1. As this is an international, country-based tournament, very early or late local match times are unavoidable for certain matchups.
2. All matches will be given a default match time by administration.
3. Teams will be scheduled on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) by default. It is expected that teams are available on these days throughout the tournament.
4. Schedules will be provided no later than the Monday before the match weekend.
5. Qualifiers may **not** be scheduled past the Monday following the qualifiers weekend at 2:00 UTC, no exceptions.
6. Teams that do not schedule a qualifier lobby or do not complete a full qualifier lobby in time will be **disqualified**.
7. Teams may request any time they want for a Qualifier Lobby during the qualifiers weekend. Our team will be as accommodating as possible.
8. If a scheduling conflict arises between two countries and cannot be resolved by Friday 23:59 UTC, administration will intervene.
9. It is the responsibility of each team’s captain (not organizer) to request and submit reschedules on time.
10. The scheduling or rescheduling of Qualifier Lobbies and Matches must be done **at least 24 hours** before the time you are requesting.
11. Administration reserves the right to overwrite a default schedule for any reason at any time.
12. Administration also reserves the right to approve or deny reschedule requests if necessary.
13. If a team captain fails to respond to a reschedule request in a reasonable amount of time (roughly 24 hours), administration will intervene.
14. If a team captain requests a totally unreasonable reschedule, it will be denied.
15. Teams reserve the right to deny reschedule requests, however, in situations where it is clear a team is being unreasonably stubborn to the point of affecting the integrity of the matchup, administration will intervene.

# Freemod Rules
1. **4 mods** minimum.
2. Teams may overmod as much as they want.
3. **1 HD** and **1 HR** are required. These may also be substituted for their equivalents, described below.
4. **EZ** counts as a **HD** replacement.
5. **HDHR** counts as two mods, but **not** as **HR** nor **HD**.
   - You will need to have **1 HD** and **1 HR** separately. **HDHR** explicitly counts for the number of mods on a team - nothing more.
   - To clarify: Teams must have a ***lone*** **HD** (or **EZ/EZHD**) and a ***lone*** **HR** player.
6. **EZHD** only counts for **HD** and is **not** worth two mods.
   - This same rule applies to **EZFL**
7. **EZHDFL** counts as two mods and follows the same multiplier as **EZFL**
8. Example combinations
   - **HD**, **HR**, **HDHR**, **NM**
   - **HD**, **HR**, **HD/HR/EZ/EZHD/FL**, **HD/HR/EZ/EZHD/FL**
   - **EZ/EZHD**, **HR**, **HDHR**, **NM**
   - **EZ/EZHD**, **HR**, **HD/HR/EZ/EZHD/FL**, **HD/HR/EZ/EZHD/FL**
9. No Fail (NF) does not count as a mod
10. Allowed mods: **EZ**, **HD**, **HR**, **FL**

## Freemod Multipliers
- **EZ** - 1.75x
- **HR** - 1.04x
  - Note: **HDHR** is still worth 1.0x and is not affected by this multiplier.
- **FL** - 1.40x
- **EZFL** - 2.15x
